    "# 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    " Functions provide modularity, reusability, and organization of code. They allow you to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "#The code in a function runs when the function is called using its name followed by parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "#The \"def\" statement is used to create a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "#A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. A function call is the act of invoking the function to execute its code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "#There is one global scope in a Python program. Local scopes are created whenever a function is called, and they are separate for each function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "#Variables in a local scope are destroyed (except those that were returned or saved in some way) when the function call returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "#A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to and sends back to the caller. Yes, it's possible to use a function's return value within an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "#If a function lacks a return statement, the return value is \"None\".\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    " By using the \"global\" keyword inside the function before the variable assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "#The data type of None is \"NoneType\".\n",
    "\n",
    "# 11. What does the sentence \"import areallyourpetsnamederic\" do?\n",
    " It imports a module named \"areallyourpetsnamederic\".\n",
    "\n",
    "# 12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    " You would call it using \"spam.bacon()\".\n",
    "\n",
    "# 13. What can you do to save a program from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    " You can use exception handling using try and except blocks to catch and handle errors gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    " The try clause is used to enclose code that might raise an exception. The except clause specifies how to handle the exception that might occur within the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    " Sample code demonstrating the concepts:\n",
    " \n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = a / b\n",
    "        return result\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        return \"Cannot divide by zero\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    print(greet(\"Alice\"))\n",
    "    \n",
    "    result = divide(10, 2)\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    result = divide(5, 0)\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "\n",
    "main()\n"
